          When you install the App, we are automatically able to access certain types of information from your Shopify account:

          <br><br>
          From the information above, only the order ID are stored in the app database, for the app to verify if an order has updated shipping address sucessfully, no other data from the order is stored in the app database.
          <br><br>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Customer Information the App Collects</h3>
          The app collects the order's customer information, including customer name, customer phone, customer email and customer shipping address.

          These customer information is used to populate the edit address form with the customer name, email, phone and shipping address, to show the current shipping address and contact method being used for the order in the edit shipping address form.
          <br><br>
          <strong>These customer information (name, email, phone and shipping address) is never stored in the app database</strong>, the app will request these information from Shopify every time a customer visit the order status / thank you page (that has the edit shipping address form), and when the customer clicks "Update shipping address".
          <br><br>
          These customer information are only kept in ephemeral Random Access Memory (RAM) during access, and is immediately discarded after the customer information is displayed successfully on the order status page, or after the shipping address of an order has successfully updated.
          <br><br>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Data Retention Period</h3>
          For customer data (customer name, phone, email, shipping address), the app will request the customer data from Shopify when the app is loaded on the order status page, and also when the app receive the new shipping address input from customer.
          <br><br>
          When the app is loaded on the order status page, the app will request the customer data from Shopify, and the customer data is used to display on the edit shipping address form, and the customer data will be discarded immediately right after the customer information is displayed successfully on the edit shipping address form in the order status page.
